# Type System — round-out plan

*Status (verified 2026-07-09 at `dbe188d`): **MOSTLY SHIPPED** — `experiment/type-system` is
merged into main and is no longer a live branch. Phases 0–4 are in the tree (`src/types.rs` holds
the `Type` lattice, `src/class_table.rs` the parallel `ClassSig` table; nil-narrowing and
span+caret diagnostics both work — `qn check qnlib/warnings.qn` is the gallery, pinned in CI by
`tests/check_warnings.rs` after two silent drifts, RELEASE_PREP Tier 4b), plus several
Phase-5 optimizer slices. **Remaining:** 3c·3 loop back-edge widening, 3c·4d nullable-guard
inline recovery, and the rest of Phase 5.*

Actionable plan for evolving Quoin's static types from a *targeted optimization aid* into a real
*gradual type checker* with good error ergonomics — while keeping the dynamic-by-default feel.
Companion to `docs/internal/FUTURE_ARCH.md` (the two converge — see "Synergy").

## Where it is today (grounding)

Types already do real work, but **at runtime, for two non-checking purposes**:

- **Multimethod dispatch.** Param types (`|n: Integer|`) select a method *variant* by the argument's
  runtime type (scored by type-distance). Full class types. A mismatch is a **runtime** MNU, not a
  compile error. (Because dispatch guarantees the param type, the body needs no runtime guard —
  compiler.rs "the param is provably that type… no runtime guard needed".)
- **The optimizer.** A tiny **4-value lattice** — `StaticType { Int, Bool, List, Unknown }` — propagated
  forward at compile time to decide when to emit a devirtualized op.

And critically: **the compiler emits zero type errors.** Annotations are optimizer hints + dispatch
selectors; a wrong annotation just fails to optimize or fails later at runtime. There is no *type
checker*. Un-annotated block args eagerly default to `"Object"` (the dispatch catch-all). Good error
*rendering* (source span + caret) exists for parse/runtime errors, but there is no type-diagnostic
channel.

**The reframe:** the runtime already understands rich types; the compile-time side is a thin,
un-checking shadow. Rounding out = lift compile-time understanding to what the runtime already knows,
and add the checker.

## Goal & stance

Round out into a **gradual, best-effort type checker**: catch type bugs at compile time, with good
ergonomics, opt-in, never nagging on dynamic code.

- **Best-effort first** (TypeScript-style): check where types are written, trust dynamic code, add no
  new runtime machinery. The optimizer already gets soundness from dispatch + per-op fallback, so the
  checker does **not** need to be sound for perf.
- **Sound-gradual deferred** (Typed Racket-style boundary contracts): add later, only where hard
  guarantees are wanted.

## Decisions from the design discussion

1. **Un-annotated params are `Any`, not `Object`.** Stop eager-defaulting to `"Object"`
   (compiler.rs ~2437). Keep the annotation optional (`None`) and **decouple the two readings of
   "absent"**:
   - *Dispatch* treats absence as the **catch-all** variant (unchanged runtime behavior).
   - *The checker* treats absence as **`Any`** — gradual, unchecked → no false errors on dynamic code
     (e.g. `{ |x| x.customMethod }` must not error).
   `Object` (restrictive top class) and `Any` (gradual escape) are **distinct types**. Explicit
   `|x: Object|` → the restrictive top class (revisit if that proves annoying). **General principle:
   eager defaults that serve the runtime become lies to the checker — audit others (return types,
   field types, collection elements) for the same trap.**
2. **Defer "suggest the fix" (did-you-mean).** Ecosystem/method-surface too small to be worth the
   fine-tuning, and a *wrong* suggestion is worse than none. Revisit when the ecosystem is larger.

## Settled surface syntax

Three type-syntax decisions, locked before building the parser/resolver around them:

**Namespaced type names — `[Ns]Name` allowed in every type position.** All four annotation
positions (`|x:T|`, `var x: T`, `^T`, block-local `- x:T`) share one grammar rule,
`type_ref = namespace? ~ ident`, so `|e:[Web]Halt|` and `var f: [IO]File` parse. An annotation
resolves exactly like an expression-position global: bare `Name` = the root namespace (never a
leaf-name match against some `[X]Name`), `[/]Name` = explicit root (canonicalized to bare).
Checker/`SeenTypes`/`ClassTable` keys and runtime dispatch hints all use the rendered
`NamespacedName` form (`[Web]Halt`), matching `populate_from_vm`'s keying.

**Nullable — `Integer?`.** `?` is an identifier character (so `nil?`/`empty?` are single tokens),
which means `Integer?` lexes as *one* identifier. So nullability is a **resolver** rule, not a
grammar change: a type-position identifier ending in `?` → `Nullable(base)`. Unambiguous because
class names are PascalCase while predicates are lowercase. No space (`Integer ?` is not it).

**Generics — `Class(args)`, space-separated.** `List(Integer)`, `Map(String Integer)`. `<…>` is
ruled out (`<`/`>` are operators + `<-`/`<--`/`->`/`-->` arrows, plus the `>>` nesting problem);
`[…]` is namespaces; `{…}` is blocks. A bare `ident(…)` is unused (sends are `.sel:`), so parens
are free, delimited, and nest cleanly: `Map(String List(Integer))`.

**Block signatures — `Block(args… ^Ret)`, and `^Ret` moves into the block header.** A function
type needs both args and a return, and a flat list can't tell `Block(Integer Integer)` (two args,
`Any` return) from a one-arg/one-return reading. The fix: mark the return with `^`, reusing
Quoin's return operator. So `^` means "the return" in three positions — statement (`^ expr`),
header annotation (`|a ^Ret|`), and type slot (`Block(… ^Ret)`). This makes **a block's type its
header with the names stripped**:

```
{ |a:Integer b:Integer ^Integer| … }   ⟺   Block(Integer Integer ^Integer)
```

Consequences: `->` is de-overloaded back to just the method arrow (`sel -> { … }`); the return
type moves out of `-> Ret` into the header as `^Ret`; **a bare (non-method) block can now declare
its return type** (`{ |x ^Integer| … }`), which `-> Ret {}` couldn't reach. No `^` ⇒ `Any` return;
`Block()` = zero args / `Any`; `Block` (no parens) = fully unconstrained. `^` is single (the
block's own return), never `^^` (that's the non-local return, a control-flow marker, not a type).
`^Ret` sits after the args, before the `-` local-decl separator; and last in `Block(… ^Ret)`.

## Work plan (sequenced)

### Phase 0 — migrate the return-type syntax (do first)
Move the return type from `sel -> Ret { |args| }` (Slice 2b-A) to `sel -> { |args ^Ret| }`, per
the settled syntax above. Touches: the pest grammar (drop `ret_type` after `op_meth`; add
`block_ret = "^" ident` to `block_decls`), the AST (`return_type` moves from the method nodes onto
`BlockNode`), the parser + compiler (`collect_class_ctx` reads `m.block.return_type`), the
highlighter, the ~4 qnlib/test sites, and the IntelliJ plugin. Mechanical and small; done before
Phase 1 so the resolver/checker build on the final location.

### Phase 1 — the real `Type` representation (foundation) ✅ DONE
Landed in `src/types.rs` (`Type` enum + `Type::from_annotation_name`); `compiler.rs` swapped
off `StaticType`. Behavior-preserving — the devirt gates still act only on `Int`/`List`/`Bool`
and treat every other type (`Any` included) as "no static knowledge", so codegen is byte-identical.
`Instance` uses the class **name** (`Arc<str>`), not a numeric `ClassId` (no class registry yet).

Replace `StaticType{Int,Bool,List,Unknown}` with a proper `Type`:
- **Builtins**: `Int`, `Double`, `Bool`, `String`, `Nil`, `List`, `Map`, `Set`, `Block`.
- **User class types**: `Instance(ClassId)`.
- **Nullability**: `T?` (union with `Nil`) — Quoin has `nil`, so this matters a lot.
- **`Any`** (gradual escape) — DISTINCT from `Object` (the top class).
- **`Never`** (bottom).
- Later: generics (`List(T)` / `Block(args… ^Ret)` — see Settled surface syntax), general unions.

This is the shared substrate for both the checker and the optimizer.

### Phase 2 — resolver ✅ DONE
Resolve annotations → `Type` against a real known-class set and flag unknown names. Landed as
`Compiler::resolve_annotation` + a `SeenTypes` accumulator (`src/types.rs`); un-annotated → `Any`
(the `"Object"` default is now only the runtime *dispatch* signature, decoupled from the static type).

Decisions (forced by the investigation — classes are compile-time-invisible across units, since the
runner compiles the prelude and each `use` in a *separate* `Compiler`; the VM class table isn't
reachable at compile time):
- **Non-fatal warnings**, not errors — an unknown type prints `warning: unknown type Foo` to stderr
  and still lowers/runs (gradual best-effort; also the diagnostics substrate Phase 3 needs).
- **Shared "seen types" accumulator** — one `SeenTypes` (`Rc<RefCell<HashSet>>`) rides on `VmOptions`,
  threaded into every `Compiler` the run spawns (the VM's `use`-loads *and* the runner's top-level
  program), plus a per-unit top-level pre-scan and a record-on-definition hook (catches nested defs).
  So a unit sees the classes earlier-compiled units (prelude, imports) defined — no false positives on
  stdlib types. Residual gap: a class the program itself `use`s (loaded during its *own* run) is unseen
  at its compile → a non-fatal warning.

### Phase 3 — checker pass (best-effort, gradual; **interleaved** into the compile pass)
Bidirectional (check against annotations where present, infer where absent), gradual (never speak on
`Any` or an unknown class), non-fatal warnings on the `diagnostics` channel. Staged:

**3a — self-contained checks ✅ DONE** (VM `ca76d3e` + `65d8557`). `Type::compatible_with` (strict —
signatures never widen) + `static_type` extended to synthesize all literal types.
- **Return type**: a block/method's tail and `^`/`^^` returns checked against its declared `|args ^T|`.
- **Typed decl**: `var x: T = expr` resolves `T` (also flags unknown types in decls), checks the
  initializer, and records `T`.
- **Numeric promotion is value-level, not type-level**: an `Integer` *literal* where a `Double` is
  expected is emitted as a `Double` (`^Double { 1 }` → `1.0`); a non-constant `Integer` → warning.

**3b — cross-class checks ✅ DONE** (VM `54be965` … `8e0b8ad`). A parallel `ClassTable`
(`src/class_table.rs`: name → {parent, mixins, own selectors, sealed, per-method param types}), threaded
like `SeenTypes`, populated from the current-unit AST **+ `introspect::describe_class`** for VM-resident
classes (reuses the `$inspect` extraction; VM sigs are `from_vm` = authoritative — they include native
methods + applied `Foo <-- {}` extensions). Resolution (`responds_to`) walks the *exact* dispatch order,
so no drift; the corpus (0 false positives on thousands of real sends) + a checker-vs-VM cross-check test
are the anti-drift guards.
- **`Instance` subtyping** — in `check_type` via the parent/mixin chain (only ever *removes* false positives).
- **Compile-time MNU** — a send to a selector the receiver's class can't answer.
- **Argument-type checks + promotion** — args checked/promoted against the method's param types.

MNU and arg-checks are gated on **`from_vm` + `sealed`** (an open class could gain the method/overload, so
staying silent there is sound); missed check = fine, false positive = not. Inline-block-args still deferred.

**3c — flow-sensitive type narrowing (nil-first, generic framework).** The hardest slice; needs real
flow analysis to avoid false positives. Built as a **general refinement layer**, not a nil special case.

*Core decision.* A per-program-point overlay maps a **narrowable path** (`Local(name)` or `Field(@name)`)
→ refined `Type`, laid over the flow-insensitive `types`/`declared_types` scope maps. The **mechanism is
type-generic** (any `Type` refinement); only the initial **rule set** is nil-specific. `static_type` /
`local_type` consult the overlay — a narrowed key's type wins.

*Guard grammar (from a corpus survey — the guard is a syntactic shape, not one operator).* `.defined?` is
a plain Bool-returning method (`true` on any object, overridden `--> false` on Nil), composed with the
`.if:`/`.else:` sends. So the true-arm narrows to **non-nil** (reverse polarity of a `nil?` check):

| idiom | narrows |
|---|---|
| `RECV.defined?.if:{A} else:{B}` | `A`: RECV non-nil · `B`: RECV nil |
| `RECV.defined?.else:{B}` | `B`: RECV nil; if `B` diverges (`^^`/`^`/throw) → RECV non-nil *after* |
| `RECV.defined?.if:{A}` | `A`: RECV non-nil |
| `RECV == nil` / `!= nil` as the condition | polarity-flipped |
| `RECV.defined? && EXPR` | `EXPR`: RECV non-nil (short-circuit) |

`RECV` is a local *or* a `@field` (the corpus narrows fields heavily). The condition matching keys off the
**AST shape**, hooked at the existing `try_compile_inlined_conditional` site — but *independent of the
devirt-inline gate* (that needs a statically-Bool receiver; `x.defined?` types as `Any` today).

*Two surfaces.* (1) **Read side (narrowing)** — the overlay above. (2) **Use side (the payoff):** a
non-nil-safe send to a *confidently* `Nullable(T)` receiver → `warning: receiver may be nil`. Nil-safe
allowlist: `defined?`, `==`, `!=`, `s`, `pp`, `class`, `hash`. **Gated to explicit `T?` or a
narrowed-nullable**, silent on `Any`/unknown — so it speaks only on code that opts in by annotating `T?`.
The corpus annotates nothing `T?` yet, so the misuse check is **silent on today's corpus by construction**;
the corpus's role here is to prove *narrowing* adds no regressions.

*Slices.*
- **3c·0 — representation + locked grammar.** Overlay + `NarrowKey`; wire `static_type`; lock the grammar
  above. No checks; corpus unchanged. Settles the open questions below.
- **3c·1 — arm + divergence narrowing (Tier 1, the 80%).** Recognize the shape; compile arms with
  refinements; post-guard narrowing when the nil-arm diverges (`defined?.else:{ ^^… }`). Reassignment /
  field-write **widens**. No user warning yet; validate via corpus + narrowing unit tests.
- **3c·2 — the nil-misuse check (payoff).** Warn on non-nil-safe sends to a confidently-nullable,
  un-narrowed receiver. Corpus 0 false positives + positive tests.
- **3c·3 — join/merge + loops (Tier 2).** `&&` short-circuit narrowing DONE (`421c049`). **Arm-exit
  join/merge DONE** (`4fc8dd4`): after a guard conditional the guarded key's type is the **join** of the
  arms' exit states (via `Type::join`, the nil-lattice LUB = the union constructor, kept nil-scoped), not a
  revert to the declared type — so `x.defined?.if:{} else:{x=0}; x+1` sees `x` as `Integer`. Arm exits are
  captured by a one-shot `next_block_capture` mirroring `next_block_narrowing`; `apply_guard_join` subsumes the
  old divergence path (diverging arms drop out, surviving/fall-through paths join). **Sound by construction:** a
  guard fires only on a declared `T?`, so the join is always `⊑ T?` and the checks are monotonic → a missed
  (nested) reassignment is a false *negative*, never a new false positive. **Still deferred:** conservative loop
  back-edge widening (its own mechanism, zero corpus impact). **Follow-up gap:** a typed *param* (`|x: Integer?|`)
  uses `record_local_type` (devirt hint), not `record_declared_type`, so a param *reassignment* doesn't
  flow-update narrowing — the join's reassignment case works for `var` locals but not params; making param
  annotations declared-contracts is a small orthogonal change (needs its own corpus 0-FP check).
- **3c·4 — return-type covariance (unlocks sound `defined? → Bool`).** The doc's original 3c·4 bonus —
  `static_type(x.defined?) → Bool` — was *unsound as stated*: `defined?` is a plain overridable Quoin method
  (`Object#defined? -> { true }`, `nil` → `false`; qnlib/core/00-bootstrap.qn), so a user class could reopen it
  to return non-Bool → the inline path uses a *guarded* inline precisely to stay safe. The fix is the **Liskov
  rule for returns**: an override may return a *subtype* of the base return, never a widened/unrelated type.
  Enforce that on `Object#defined? : Bool` and no class can make `x.defined?` non-Bool → typing it `Bool` for
  *any* receiver becomes sound, narrowing/nil-misuse see through it, and every untyped `x.defined?.if:` in the
  corpus upgrades from a guarded to a **direct** inline (a corpus-wide codegen win). Also finally delivers the
  long-deferred "persist return types" idea. Trust basis: the covariance check is a gradual *warning* (not a
  hard error), so `defined? → Bool` is a contract-backed judgment on the *same* basis the VM already uses to
  direct-inline `var b: Bool` — no new soundness class; corpus 0-FP stays the tripwire.
  - **3c·4a DONE** (`c5398a9`) — `method_returns: HashMap<selector, Type>` on `ClassSig`; populate declared
    returns (`block.return_type`) from the AST for **both** `ClassDefinition` (`Foo <- {}`) *and* `ClassExtension`
    reopens of a simple class name (`Object <-- {}` — how the core classes add methods, since they're reopened
    not `<-`-defined); `ClassTable::insert` **merges/preserves** `method_returns` + `add_returns` augments a reopen
    so a later `populate_from_vm` (from_vm sigs carry no returns today) doesn't clobber accumulated ones. No reader
    yet → corpus unchanged. (The pre-fix `qn fmt` return-only-header bug that blocked `|^Bool|` headers was fixed
    first in `6bfbd30`.)
  - **3c·4b DONE** (`e5455bc`) — declared `^Boolean` on `Object#defined?` (+ `nil` override) in bootstrap;
    **covariance check** (`ClassTable::inherited_return` = nearest ancestor's declared return, with `Object` as an
    implicit universal-root fallback): an override's known return must be `compatible_with` the base, else warn
    (`override of \`sel\` returns \`X\`, incompatible with \`Y\` from \`Class\``, with span). *Confident-only* —
    `override_return_violates` speaks on a scalar mismatch or a **proven** non-subtype between two bare classes
    (consulting `is_subtype`), silent on Any/mixed/nullable-of-class → 0-FP. Corpus 0-FP verified.
  - **3c·4c DONE** (`0b6c6f1`) — `object_rooted_return_type`: `static_type(RECV.sel) →` the declared return of an
    **Object-rooted** no-arg method (covariance makes it sound for any receiver), giving `x.defined? → Boolean`;
    feeds narrowing, nil-misuse, and the direct-inline path. A bytecode regression test pins the guarded→direct
    upgrade. Corpus 1255/0/0 + GC stress, behavior-preserving; covariance case added to `qnlib/warnings.qn`.
    *Declares only `defined?` for now — other Object return contracts are follow-ups, each corpus-verified.*
  - **3c·4d — DEFERRED (nullable-guard inline recovery).** The 3c·1 early-return keeps *declared-`T?`* guards on
    the general (non-inlined) send path so their arms narrow; recovering the inline for them needs per-arm
    narrowing spliced into the inline path (`emit_inline_conditional_body`/`inline_block_body` save-restore of
    the `narrowed` overlay). Opt-in, **zero corpus impact today** (nothing annotates `T?`) → deferred. The
    corpus-wide *untyped*-guard win (3c·4c) needs none of this.
  - Provenance seed + doc/memory + corpus/stress/fmt land across 4b/4c.

*Correctness guards.* Corpus 0 false positives is the tripwire (as in 3a/3b); gradual (silent on
`Any`/unknown); a unit test per rule (arm polarity, divergence, reassignment-widen, merge, loop-conservatism,
field-invalidation).

*Open questions for 3c·0.* (1) Field-narrowing conservatism — invalidate `@x`'s narrowing on `@x = …`, and
also on any `self`-send that could reassign it (leaning yes). (2) Bare `.else:` on a Bool — recognized for
narrowing regardless of codegen inlining. (3) The exact nil-safe allowlist.

*Future unlocked by this framework (generic by design):*
- **Type-test narrowing** — a new *condition rule* (`x is-a Dog` → `Dog` in the arm) on the same overlay,
  reusing 3b's subtype relation. The framework is rule-agnostic.
- **General union types** (Phase 1 deferred these) — 3c's **join** operation *is* the union constructor;
  today it joins only `T`/`Nullable(T)`, but generalizing join → `A｜B` is the natural next step, and
  narrowing then becomes "narrow a union to a member." **3c is the substrate for unions.**
- **Exhaustiveness** (a `case` over a union), **reachability / dead-code** and **definite-assignment** (both
  seeded by the divergence tracking), and **devirt** (a narrowed non-nil/exact type removes nil-checks and
  enables monomorphic inlining — Phase 5).

*Cross-cutting follow-up (not a blocker): an AST-matcher.* Structural recognizers are accreting
(`call_selector_*`, `receiver_class`, `is_sealed_marker`, `mixin_target`, plus 3c's guard shapes), each a
nested `if let … && matches!(…)` chain that's easy to get subtly wrong (the 3b variadic-fold bug was one).
Extract a matcher **after ~3 real 3c matchers land** (rule of three), shaped by the real patterns — start
with composable matcher fns / `macro_rules!` combinators, reserve a proc-macro surface-syntax DSL only if it
earns it. Hard constraint: Quoin AST matching is **not purely structural** (a selector is a *reconstruction*
with variadic folding; local-vs-`@field`-vs-`Instance` are semantic predicates), so the matcher must **bottom
out on the existing helpers**, never re-derive them.

### Phase 4 — error ergonomics
Reuse the existing span + caret renderer. Deliver:
- **Precise spans** — caret under the offending sub-expression (AST already carries `source_info`).
- **Actual vs expected** in Quoin's type names.
- **The why-chain (provenance)** — the highest-value feature: "`x`: `String` — inferred at line 3 from
  `x = name`." Track where each inferred type came from.
- **Root cause, not cascade** — report the source mismatch, suppress downstream.
- **Gradual-friendly** — silence on `Any`.
- *(Deferred: fix-suggestions / did-you-mean.)*

### Phase 5 — feed the optimizer
Let devirt/inlining consume the richer `Type` (receiver's exact class → method inlining; `List<Int>` →
unboxed elements). Method inlining is the documented highest-ROI Tier-1 lever (`docs/internal/FUTURE_ARCH.md`) and
subsumes the "skip lookup" win *without* the ruled-out per-call-site inline cache. Key enabler: a **sealed
class can't be subclassed** (`ensure_not_sealed`), so a self-send to its own method is provably monomorphic
at compile time — the compiler already proves this for `CallSelfDirect` (which today is a no-op = `Send`;
its designed "Phase 2 cache" was never built and is the ruled-out path — don't).

- **5·1 — leaf self-send inlining DONE** (`ca903aa`). A no-arg self-send in a sealed class to one of its own
  **leaf** methods (body = a single trivial terminal: `@field` / `self` / a reserved literal / an
  `Int`/`Double`/`String` constant) is inlined — the body is spliced at the call site (`self` is identical on
  both sides), replacing receiver-push + dispatch + frame + `exec_send` with one load/push. `ClassCtx` gains a
  `selector → Arc<BlockNode>` map; `inlinable_leaf_body` gates the shape; `try_inline_leaf_self_send` splices.
  Leaf ⇒ no sub-sends ⇒ no recursion. Accessor-heavy bench (6 accessor self-sends/call, 10M iters):
  whole-process **9.85s → 4.50s, ~2.2×**; corpus 1255/0/0 + GC-stress unchanged (`profiling/method-inlining/`).
- **5·2 — non-leaf self-send inlining DONE** (`3031195`). `inlinable_body` broadened from trivial terminals to
  any **inline-safe expression** (terminal / operator / block-free method call), so a computed self-send like
  `self.area` (`.width * .height`) is spliced too, and its inner leaf self-sends inline in turn. **Soundness
  crux: blocks are excluded** — a block is the only place a `^^` (return-from-method) hides, and an inlined `^^`
  would return from the *caller's* method; no block ⇒ no `^^` ⇒ safe. A `MAX_INLINE_DEPTH` (=3) guard bounds
  recursive/fan-out expansion. Computed-self-send bench (`.bumped` in a 10M loop): **2.69s → 1.82s, ~1.48×**;
  corpus 1255/0/0 + GC-stress unchanged.
- **5·3 — exact-receiver field-accessor inlining DONE** (`7b47db6`). New **`LoadFieldOf(name)`** instruction
  (pop the TOS object, push its field — `LoadField` on an arbitrary object, not `self`; `field_of` factored
  out). `v.x` where `v` is statically an instance of the *current* sealed class and `x` is a field accessor
  (`x -> { @x }`) compiles to `<eval v>; LoadFieldOf(x)` — no dispatch, no frame. Sound: sealed ⇒ no subclass ⇒
  `v` is exactly that class; a non-nullable typed receiver is never nil. `ClassCtx` gains its `name` (to match
  receiver-class == current-class). Exact-receiver-accessor bench (`other.x` in a 10M loop): **1.71s → 0.95s,
  ~1.8×**; corpus 1255/0/0 + GC-stress unchanged.
- **5·3b — exact-receiver accessors on any in-unit sealed class DONE** (`e7bf6b6`). Compiler-wide
  `class_bodies: class → selector → body` map (populated as each class compiles — backward refs, in-unit), so
  `p.x` where `p: SomeSiblingClass` inlines to `LoadFieldOf` too, not just same-class operands. Sealed check
  moved to the ClassTable flag; `ClassCtx.name` dropped as redundant. Sibling-accessor bench (`Reader` reads
  `Point.x` in a 10M loop): **1.70s → 0.95s, ~1.8×**; corpus 1255/0/0 + GC-stress unchanged.
- **5·3c — computed exact-receiver bodies DONE** (`ef590cf`). New `self_override` compile mode: to splice a
  non-field `v.foo` body, the receiver is evaluated once into a temp and the body compiled with `self` rebound —
  `@x` → `LoadLocal(tmp); LoadFieldOf(x)`, `self` → `LoadLocal(tmp)`, an implicit self-send dispatches on `tmp`
  (self-send inlining gated off under the override). Field accessors keep the temp-free fast path;
  `try_inline_exact_receiver` unifies both. Same soundness gate (inline-safe ⇒ no block ⇒ no `^^`). Computed-
  receiver bench (`p.area` = `@x * @y` × 10M): **2.37s → 1.95s, ~1.2×** (temp store/load offsets some of the
  removed dispatch); corpus 1255/0/0 + GC-stress unchanged.
- **5·4 — arg-passing (with-arg methods) DONE** (`a5e8539`). `inlinable_body` allows params; a `param_override`
  (param → temp) rebinds param refs in the spliced body. Each arg is evaluated into a temp (in the caller's
  context) and the body compiled with params → those temps (+ `self` → the receiver temp for an explicit
  receiver). Self-send and exact-receiver, single/multi-arg; `inline_body_with_args` shared, `inline_selector`
  reconstructs the selector. With-arg bench (`v.scale:2` = `@x * k`, 10M loop): **2.25s → 1.77s, ~1.27×**;
  corpus 1255/0/0 + GC-stress unchanged.
- **5·5 — control-flow method bodies DONE** (`e83aaba`). The blanket block-exclusion became precise: the gate is
  now `escapes_inlined_frame` (recursive scan for `^^`/`^>`) instead of "no blocks", so bodies with `.if:else:`/
  `.whileDo:` blocks and `^` (block-return) inline. The body is spliced through `inline_block_body` (which
  redirects each `^` to the inlined value — the existing Slice-2d caret mechanism), so multi-statement bodies
  work too. `^^` (return-from-*method*) and `^>` (fiber-yield) still escape the callee frame, so they stay
  excluded. Recursion is **bounded-unrolled** by `MAX_INLINE_DEPTH` (K levels, then dispatch). Control-flow
  method in a loop: **2.27s → 1.75s, ~1.3×**; **fib(30): 0.96s → 0.89s, ~8%** — bounded unroll of *exponential*
  recursion is inherently modest (the 2^K leaves still dispatch; the dramatic `fib` win is Tier-2 native codegen,
  out of scope). Corpus 1255/0/0 + GC-stress unchanged.
- **5·6+ (next):** redirect `^^` to the inlined-call's end (a second caret channel) → inline `^^`-bearing bodies;
  **alpha-rename** spliced local bindings → inline `var`/`let` bodies; **cross-unit** receiver bodies (via the VM
  class object, not the AST).
- **`CallSelfDirect` removed DONE** (`e98cd0b`): it was a runtime no-op (identical `exec_send` to `Send`) whose
  planned resolve-and-cache was the ruled-out inline cache, *and* it blocked fusion (a sealed self-send emitted
  an unfused `LoadLocal(self); CallSelfDirect` where `Send` fuses to `SendLocal*`). `emit_call` now emits `Send`;
  the variant, its VM arm, and the now-dead `ClassCtx.methods` field are gone. Self-send-with-arg bench: 2.09s →
  2.02s, ~3%. Corpus 1255/0/0 + GC-stress unchanged.

## Deferred / follow-up tasks (tracked)
- **3c·3 loop back-edge widening** — the other Tier-2 half (arm-exit join/merge is done, `4fc8dd4`). Narrowing
  across a loop must conservatively widen at the back-edge (a value narrowed in one iteration may not hold on
  re-entry). Its own mechanism; zero corpus impact → deferred.
- **Typed-param declared contracts — DONE** (`6a5909c`): a `|x: T|` param now records via
  `record_declared_type`, so its annotation is a contract — reassignment is checked *and* flow-updates
  narrowing, completing the arm-exit join for nullable params. Corpus 1255/0/0. **Surfaced** the `Object`-as-top
  gap below.
- **`Object` annotation → top type `Any` — DONE** (`df54bfe`): `from_annotation_name("Object")` now yields
  `Any` (not `Instance("Object")`), so `var x: Object = …` / `|x: Object|` no longer false-positive `expected
  Object, found …`; `Object?` collapses to `Any` too. All six callers benefit (checker decls/params/returns,
  covariance, VM-sourced arg-checks); the runtime `Object` *string* (dispatch/hierarchy) is a separate path,
  untouched. Corpus 1255/0/0.
- **3c·4d — nullable-guard inline recovery** (see the 3c·4d slice above): per-arm narrowing spliced into the
  inline path so declared-`T?` guards inline *and* narrow. Opt-in, zero corpus impact → deferred.
- **Fork-1b — persist return types into runtime introspection.** 3c·4a records declared returns into the
  *checker's* `ClassTable` from the AST. The runtime `MethodVariant`/`introspect::ClassInfo` still carry no
  return type, so `from_vm` sigs contribute none and `$inspect`/`describe_class` can't show returns. The bigger
  follow-up: have the compiler's accumulated return types flow into runtime introspection (compiler →
  `MethodVariant`), so `$inspect` shows returns *and* cross-unit return contracts survive without relying on the
  AST-recording + merge-preserve path. Cheap-ish once 3c·4a's accumulator exists; also lifts the
  cross-class-return→`Any` limit noted in Phase 3b.
- **Object return contracts beyond `defined?`** — `s : String` and `pp : String` **DONE** (`8c0336d`). These
  two are *native* (Rust) methods with no `^Ret` AST header, so their contracts are **seeded** into the
  ClassTable via `seed_native_object_returns` (called from `populate_from_vm`) rather than declared in bootstrap;
  one source feeds both object-rooted typing and covariance. `hash` is *not* native on `Object` and `class`
  returns a class object (needs a `Class` type) — both skipped. Further native contracts would follow the same
  seed pattern until the TODO below lands.
- **TODO — native-method return-type declarations (replaces the seed hardcoding).** Native methods already
  declare *arg* types at registration — `typed_class_method(sel, &["Integer"], fn)` /
  `sdk_typed_{instance,class}_method` in `src/value.rs`, threaded via `NativeMethodDef` → `introspect::ClassInfo`
  → `ClassSig::from_class_info` (which fills `method_params`). **Extend the same path to a return type**: add an
  optional return annotation to those builders (a `_ret` variant or an extra `&str`), carry it on
  `NativeMethodDef`/the VM method variant, surface it in `introspect`, and populate `ClassSig.method_returns`
  (currently hardcoded `HashMap::new()` for `from_vm` sigs). Then `Object#s`/`#pp` (and any native method)
  declare `→ String` at their own registration site, and the checker picks it up via `from_vm` — deleting the
  `seed_native_object_returns` special-case and generalizing beyond a hand-picked few. Straightforward (mirrors
  the existing arg-type wiring); this is the *native-method half* of **Fork-1b** (compiler-declared returns are
  the other half), so the two are best done together — both make `from_vm` sigs carry returns.

## Synergy with the perf roadmap

Not a detour from perf: **the real `Type` representation is the same substrate Tier-1 method inlining
needs** (`docs/internal/FUTURE_ARCH.md`) — inlining requires knowing the receiver's exact class, which the
4-value lattice cannot express. Build the `Type` representation once; both the checker's diagnostics and
the next perf tier benefit. Ergonomics and performance converge on the same investment.
